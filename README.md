# UeberDB2: Abstract your databases

## About

✓ UeberDB turns every database into a simple key value store by providing a
layer of abstraction between your software and your database.

✓ UeberDB uses a cache and buffer to make databases faster. Reads are cached and
writes are done in a bulk. This can be turned off.

✓ UeberDB does bulk writing ergo reduces the overhead of database transactions.

✓ UeberDB uses a simple and clean syntax ergo getting started is easy.

## Database Support

* Couch
* Dirty
* Elasticsearch
* Maria
* MsSQL
* MySQL
* Postgres (single connection and with connection pool)
* Redis
* Rethink
* SQLite

## Install

```
npm install ueberdb2
```

## Examples

### Basic

```javascript
const ueberdb = require('ueberdb2');

// mysql
const db = new ueberdb.Database('mysql', {
  user: 'root',
  host: 'localhost',
  password: '',
  database: 'store',
  engine: 'InnoDB',
});

// dirty to file system
//const db = new ueberdb.Database('dirty', {filename: 'var/dirty.db'});

async function example(db) {
  await db.init();

  // no need for await because it's already in cache.
  db.set('valueA', {a: 1, b: 2});

  db.get('valueA', function (err, value) {
    // close the database connection.
    db.close(function () {
      process.exit(0);
    });
  });
}

example(db);
```

### findKeys

```javascript
const ueberdb = require('ueberdb2');
const db = new ueberdb.Database('dirty', {filename: 'var/dirty.db'});

async function example(db){
  await db.init();

  // no need for await because it's already in cache.
  db.set('valueA', {a: 1, b: 2});
  db.set('valueA:h1', {a: 1, b: 2});
  db.set('valueA:h2', {a: 3, b: 4});

  db.findKeys('valueA:*', null, function (err, value) { // TODO: Check this
    // value will be ['valueA:h1', 'valueA:h2']
    db.close(function () {
      process.exit(0);
    });
  });
}

example(db);
```
### Getting and setting subkeys

``.get`` is useful for getting
```
"foo" : {
  ...all of this...
}
```
``.getsub`` is useful for getting
```
"foo:bar" : {
  "pads" : {
    ...all of this...
  }
}
```
``setSub`` sets the subkeys of keys IE 

```
"foo:bar" : {
  "pads" : {
    ...all of this...
  }
}
```
### ``getSub``
``key`` is the key[string] IE "foo:bar"
``subkey`` is an array of subkeys you want to get IE ``['pads','someothersubkey'];``

Example:
``const result = await db.getSub(key, subkey); // returns an array of responses``

### ``setSub`` 
``key`` is the key[string] IE "foo:bar"
``subkey`` is an array of subkeys you want to set IE ``['pads','someothersubkey'];``
``value`` is a value[string] to set IE "hello world"

Example:
``db.setSub(key, subkey, value);``


### Disabling Cache for real-time read/write

Set `db.cache = 0;` to disable caching of reads and writes.

```javascript
const ueberdb = require('ueberdb2');
const db = new ueberdb.Database('dirty', {filename: 'var/dirty.db'});

// going cacheless
async function example(db){
  await db.init();

  db.cache = 0; // kill the cache

  db.set('valueA', {a: 1, b: 2});

  db.get('valueA', function (err, value) {
    db.close(function () {
      process.exit(0);
    });
  });
}

example(db);
```

## Limitations

### findKeys query support

The following characters should be avoided in keys `\^$.|?*+()[{` as they will
cause findKeys to fail.

### findKeys database support*

The following have limitations on findKeys

* redis (Only keys of the format \*:\*:\*)
* cassandra (Only keys of the format \*:\*:\*)
* elasticsearch (Only keys of the format \*:\*:\*)
* rethink (Currently doesn't work)

For details on how it works please refer to the wiki:
https://github.com/ether/UeberDB/wiki/findKeys-functionality

### Scaling, High availability and disaster recovery.

To scale UeberDB you should use sharding especially for real time applications.
An example of this is sharding given Pads within Etherpad based on their initial
pad authors geographical location. High availability and disaster recovery can
be provided through replication of your database however YMMV on passing
Settings to your database library. Do not be under the illusion that UeberDB
provides any Stateless capabilities, it does not. An option is to use something
like rethinkdb and set cache to 0 but YMMV.

### Key Length Restrictions

Your Key Length will be limited by the database you chose to use but keep into
account portability within your application.

### doBulk operations on .set out of memory

doBulk operations that chain IE a large number of .set without a pause to handle
the channel clearance can cause a `Javascript out of heap memory`. It's very
rare this happens and is usually due to a bug in software causing a constant
write to the database.

## MySQL /MariaDB Advice

You should create your database as utf8mb4_bin.

## Redis TLS communication

If you enabled TLS on your Redis database (available since Redis 6.0) you will
need to change your connections parameters, here is an example:

```
settings:
    {
      host:
      port: rediss://<redis_database_address>:<redis_database_port>
      socket:
      database:
      password:
      client_options
    }
```

Do not provide a `host` value.

If you don't provide a certificate on the client side, you need to add the
environment variable `NODE_TLS_REJECT_UNAUTHORIZED = 0` and add the flag
`--tls-auth-clients no` when launching the redis-server to accept connections.

## How to add support for another database

1. Add your database to `packages.json`, this will happen automatically if you
   run `npm install %yourdatabase%`
1. Add some example settings to `test/lib/databases.js` for your database.
1. Look at `databases/mysql_db.js`, your module have to provide the same
   functions. Call it `DATABASENAME_db.js` and reimplement the functions for
   your database. Most of your work here will be copy/paste from other databases
   so don't be scared.
1. Add your database Travis setup steps to `.travis.yml`, see the
   `before_install` section and MySQL example. Note that MySQL has a preloaded
   script (comes from mysql.sql) which preloads the database with 1M records. If
   you can, you should do the same.
1. Run `npm test` and ensure it's working.
1. Branch from master `git checkout -b my-awesome-database` and submit a pull
   request including the changes which should include **1 new and 3 modified
   files**.
1. Once merged we really need you to be on top of maintaining your code.

## What's changed from UeberDB?

* Dropped broken databases: CrateDB, LevelDB, LMDB, and MongoDB (probably a
  breaking change for some people)
* Introduced CI.
* Introduced better testing.
* Fixed broken database clients IE Redis.
* Updated Depdendencies where possible.
* Tidied file structure.
* Improved documentation.
* Sensible name for software makes it clear that it's maintained by The Etherpad
  Foundation.
* Make db.init await / async

### Dirty_Git Easter Egg.

* I suck at hiding Easter eggs..

Dirty_git will `commit` and `push` to Git on every `set`. To use `git init` or
`git clone` within your dirty database location and then set your upstream IE
`git remote add origin git://whztevz`.

The logic behind dirty git is that you can still use dirty but you can also have
offsite backups. It's noisy and spammy but it can be useful.
